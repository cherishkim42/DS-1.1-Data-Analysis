```Python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('titanic.csv')
df.head()
```
### Plot how many of the passengers were children, youth, middle age and old?

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df['Age'].hist(bins=16)
plt.show()
```
### How many of Age values are empty (or null)?

```Python
# how many of Age values are null
df['Age'].isna().sum()
```
### Create a new column as gender, when Sex is female it is zero when sex is male it is one
```Python
# create a new column as gender, when Sex is female it is zero when sex is male it is one
df['Gender'] = df['Sex'].map( {'female': 0, 'male': 1} ).astype(int)
df.head()
```
### We have one more column (check it)

`df.shape`

### Show the majority of Age range

```Python
df['Age'].plot.box()
```

### List all of the Ages that are not null
```python
df['Age'].dropna().values
```

### Slice the dataframe for those whose Embarked section was 'C'

```Python
df[df['Embarked'] == 'C'].head()
```
### Plot the Age range for those whose Embarked were 'C'

```Python
# the age range of passenger whose their Embarked were 'C'
df[df['Embarked'] == 'C']['Age'].hist(bins=16)
```
### Apply couple of Normal Distributions to Histogram obtained above
```python
df[df['Embarked'] == 'C']['Age'].plot(kind='kde')
```
### Describe a specific column
```Python
df['Embarked'].describe()
```
### How many unique values does the 'Embarked' have?
```Python
df['Embarked'].nunique()
```
### Count the different 'Embarked' values the data-frame has
```Python
df['Embarked'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')
```
### Count the different 'Embarked' values the data-frame has and plot horizontally
```Python
df['Embarked'].value_counts().plot('barh').invert_yaxis()

# Check df['Embarked'].value_counts().plot('barh')
```
### Another way to do the count and plot it

```Python
import seaborn as sns


# Bar Chart Example #1 (Simple): Categorical Variables Showing Counts
sns.countplot(x="Embarked", palette="spring", data=df)

df['Embarked'].value_counts()

df['Sex'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar')

df['Sex'].value_counts()
```

### Plot how many of the passengers were children, youth, middle age and old based on there Sex for those who 'Embarked' in section 'C'?

```Python
df[df['Embarked'] == 'C'].groupby('Sex')['Age'].hist(bins=16)

for i in df[df['Embarked'] == 'C'].groupby('Sex')['Age']:
    print(i)

df[df['Embarked'] == 'C'].groupby('Sex')['Age'].value_counts()
```

### What is the average Age for female and male (based on sex) for those who have 'Embarked' on section 'C'?

```Python
df[df['Embarked'] == 'C'].groupby('Sex')['Age'].agg(np.mean)
```
### Which Age is the oldest for female and male (based on sex) for those who have 'Embarked' on section 'C'?
```Python
df[df['Embarked'] == 'C'].groupby('Sex')['Age'].agg(np.max)
```
### For different Ages, plot the Fare they have paid?
```Python
sns.regplot(x="Age", y="Fare", fit_reg=False, data=df)
df.plot.scatter(x="Age", y="Fare")
```
### Plot how percentage Survived for two Sex group based on the passengers class
```python
sns.barplot(x="Sex", y="Survived", hue="Pclass", data=df)
```
### Plot how many male or female were in different Passenger classes
```Python
sns.countplot(x="Sex", hue="Pclass", data=df)
```
### Verify values obtained for pertentage
```Python
df[(df['Sex'] == 'female') & (df['Pclass'] == 1)]['Survived'].value_counts()
```
### Stack plot of count based on Sex for different Passenger Class

```Python
df.groupby(['Sex'])['Pclass'].value_counts().unstack().plot(kind='bar',stacked=True)
```

### Stack plot of count based on Sex and Survival for different Passenger Class
```python
df.groupby(['Sex', 'Survived'])['Pclass'].value_counts().unstack().plot(kind='bar',stacked=True)
```
### Sometimes it is hard to read values from plot, what are the number of female and male at each Passenger Class
```Python
# df.groupby(['Sex'])['Pclass'].value_counts().unstack()
# the above and crosstab are the same
pd.crosstab(df['Sex'], df['Pclass'])

pd.crosstab(df['Sex'], df['Survived'])

pd.crosstab(df['Sex'], df['Embarked'])

```
### How to represent the above cross tab in percentage and graphically present
```Python
sns.heatmap(pd.crosstab(df['Sex'], df['Embarked'], normalize='index'), cmap="YlGnBu", annot=True)
```
