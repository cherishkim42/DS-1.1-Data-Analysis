# DS 1.1: Data Analysis & Visualization

## Course Description

In this course, students learn the foundational skills of data science, including data collection, scrubbing, analysis, and visualization with modern tools and libraries. Students gain a strong grounding in statistical concepts, utilize statistical techniques and master the science and art of data exploration and visualization to tell stories and persuade decision makers with data-driven insights.

## Prerequisites:  

[CS 1.2](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/CS-1.2-How-Data-Structures-Work)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to...

1. Conduct data manipulation and visualization
1. Understand when to reject or accept a null hypothesis
1. Apply descriptive statistics, probability, and other forms of data analysis techniques 
1. Describe and implement a plan for finding and dealing with problems in a dataset such as null values and outliers
1. Perform statistical analysis on data collections using a variety of methods 

## Schedule

**NOTE:** Due to the shorter summer sessions, for some class sessions you will see multiple topics covered. This is to ensure that we cover the same material that we normally would in non-summer terms.

**Course Dates:** Wednesday, May 29 – Wednesday, July 3, 2019 (6 weeks)

**Class Times:** Monday and Wednesday at 1:30–3:20pm (11 class sessions)

## Class Assignments

- Implement a dataset processing with Numpy only and then Pandas
- Write a function that calculate conditional probability for two arbitrary attributes and arbitrary condition

## Tutorials

Students will complete the following guided tutorials in this course:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization with App Store Dataset](http://make.sc/app-store-dataset)
- Advanced Data Analysis & Visualization with Pokémon Dataset

## Projects

Students will complete the following self-guided projects in this course:
- [Make School Summer Academy NPS Data Wrangling & Analysis](http://make.sc/sa-nps-project)
- Custom Project: Students will select a problem, identify data sources, analyze and present findings

## Evaluation

To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Do all in-class activities
- Finish all required tutorials and projects
- Pass the final exam (summative assessment). The topics for final exam would be:
  - Null hypothesis, the steps to accept or reject it
  - Statistical terms and meanings such as Z-distribution, CDF, SF, ...
  - Histogram, density estimations
  - Outlier detection
  - Correlation
