# DS 1.1: Data Analysis & Visualization

## Course Description

Learn the foundational skills of data science, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization with modern tools and libraries.
Master the science and art of data exploration and visualization to tell stories with discoveries and persuade decision makers with data-driven insights.
Collect a dataset, explore, analyze, and visualize it to discover trends, then present original insights.
Gain a strong grounding in statistical concepts including measures of center and spread, distributions, sampling, and the central limit theorem.
Utilize statistical techniques to calculate z-scores and confidence intervals, perform hypothesis tests, and identify outliers.

## Class Assignments

- Implement a dataset processing with Numpy only and then Pandas
- Write a function that calculate conditional probability for two arbitrary attributes and arbitrary condition



## Tutorials

Students will complete the following guided tutorials in this course:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization with App Store Dataset](http://make.sc/app-store-dataset)
- Advanced Data Analysis & Visualization with Pokémon Dataset


## Projects

Students will complete the following self-guided projects in this course:
- [Make School Summer Academy NPS Data Wrangling & Analysis](http://make.sc/sa-nps-project)
- Custom Project: Students will select a problem, identify data sources, analyze and present findings




### Other Class assignments

## Evaluation
To pass this course you must meet the following requirements:

- Do all in-class activities
- Finish all required tutorials and projects
- Pass the final exam (summative assessment). The topics for final exam would be:
1- Null hypothesis, the steps to accept or reject it
2- Statistical terms and meanings such as Z-distribution, CDF, SF, ...
3- Histogram, density estimations
4- Outlier detection
5- Correlation

## Attendance
Just like any job, attendance at Make School is required and a key component of your success. Attendance is being onsite from 9:30 to 5:30 each day, attending all scheduled sessions including classes, huddles, coaching and school meetings, and working in the study labs when not in a scheduled session. Working onsite allows you to learn with your peers, have access to support from TAs, instructors and others, and is vital to your learning.

Attendance requirements for scheduled sessions are:
- No more than two no call no shows per term in any scheduled session.
- No more than four excused absences per term in any scheduled session.

Failure to meet these requirements will result in a PIP (Participation Improvement Plan).  Failure to improve after the PIP is cause for not being allowed to continue at Make School.
